        <p>Hi. My name is Thandokuhle Simelane. I am from Swaziland, which is a small country at the
             southeast part of Africa. I love doing anything on computers, be it playing games, doing
              work or even trying to fix some issues. I am very excited to learn how to develop websites. </p>
